# First React Project

This repository contains my first project using the React.js library. I followed a YouTube tutorial by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) to learn and implement various React concepts. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA).

## Project Overview

In this project, I created several small applications to practice and demonstrate my understanding of React.js. The apps included are:

- **Color Picker App**
- **To-Do List App**
- **Digital Clock App**
- **Stopwatch App**

## Concepts Learned

Through this project, I have learned and applied the following React concepts:

- **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable components.
- **Props**: Passing data to components.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering components based on certain conditions.
- **Render Lists**: Rendering lists of elements efficiently.
- **Click Events**: Handling user interactions through click events.
- **useState Hook**: Managing state within functional components.
- **Updater Functions**: Updating state based on previous state values.
- **useEffect Hook**: Handling side effects in functional components.
- **useContext Hook**: Managing global state and sharing data across components.
- **useRef Hook**: Accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricardofig016/first-react-project.git
   cd first-react-project
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
